# 📁 Chapter 3: Navigating the Linux File System (My Notes)
These notes are part of my hands-on learning journey as I study to become a Linux System Administrator. 
This guide covers file permissions, navigation, and special commands for working with files and directories in Linux—along with examples, tips,
 real-world use cases.


📁 Basic File System Navigation

🔍 pwd – Print Working Directory

pwd

Shows your current directory (absolute path).

🚶 cd – Change Directory

cd /path/to/dir       # Go to absolute path
cd Documents           # Go to relative path
cd ..                  # Go up one level
cd ~                   # Go to home directory
cd -                   # Go back to previous directory

💡 Tip: Use cd ~/Downloads to jump to your Downloads folder quickly.

📂 ls – List Contents

ls              # List files
ls -l           # Long format
ls -lh          # Human-readable sizes
ls -a           # Show hidden files
ls -lhS         # Sort by size
ls -lt          # Sort by time modified

💡 Tip: Use ls -lah often to see everything in a directory including file sizes.
📤 File Operations

📄 cp – Copy Files and Directories

cp file1.txt file2.txt         # Copy file
cp -r folder1/ folder2/        # Copy directories recursively

🔀 mv – Move or Rename Files

mv file.txt /backup/           # Move file
mv oldname.txt newname.txt     # Rename file

⚠️ cp copies. mv moves or renames. mv removes the original.

🛠️ Using tr – Translate or Delete Characters

echo "HELLO WORLD" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'

Converts uppercase to lowercase.

echo "Hello  World" | tr -s ' '

-s: Squeeze repeated characters (e.g., multiple spaces to one).

echo "123abc" | tr -d '0-9'

-d: Delete characters in set.

📁 Understanding File Paths

Absolute Path: Starts from root /

cd /home/sa/Documents

Relative Path: Starts from current location

cd ../Downloads

This section, combined with permissions, gives you full control over navigating, modifying, and understanding file structures in Linux.

Up next in the series: 🧰 Exploring find, xargs, and cut for power searching and automation.



## 🌲 Understanding the File System Layout

- The root directory `/` is like the base of everything — all files and folders live under it.
- Key folders:
  - `/bin`: Basic commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`.
  - `/etc`: System-wide settings and config files.
  - `/home`: Where each user’s personal folder lives, like `/home/ryan`.
  - `/var`: Log files and dynamic content.
  - `/tmp`: Temporary files, often cleared at reboot.
  - `/usr`: Where user apps and utilities go.
  - `/dev`: Represents devices like USB drives.
  - `/mnt` and `/media`: Where external drives get mounted.
  - `/opt`: Extra apps not part of the main OS.

## 📍 Paths — Absolute vs. Relative

- **Absolute path** starts from `/` (root). Example: `/home/sasakovich/Documents`.
- **Relative path** is from wherever you are now.

🔎 find – Search for Files and Directories

find /path -name "*.txt"
find . -type f -size +10M
find / -user sa -perm 644

Common Options:

-name: Match file name

-type f: Files only

-type d: Directories only

-size: File size (e.g., +1M, -100k)

-mtime, -ctime: Modify/Create time (in days)

-exec: Run command on found items

🔗 xargs – Build and Execute Command Lines

echo "file1 file2 file3" | xargs rm

Turns input into arguments for commands

Combine with find:

find . -name "*.tmp" | xargs rm

💡 Tip: Use -0 with xargs and find if filenames have spaces:
✂️ cut – Slice Text by Fields or Characters

cut -d":" -f1 /etc/passwd     # Print usernames
cut -c1-10 file.txt            # First 10 characters of each line

-d: Delimiter

-f: Field

-c: Character position

💡 Use cut when parsing simple column data from text files.
