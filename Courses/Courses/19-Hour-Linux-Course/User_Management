# ðŸ‘¤ Linux User Management Notes

## Commands I've Learned:

- `adduser lisa` â€“ creates a user
- `usermod -d /home/lisa lisa` â€“ assigns a home directory
- `passwd lisa` â€“ sets a password

## Troubleshooting:

- Issue: "User doesn't have a home directory"  
  â†’ Fix: `sudo mkdir /home/lisa && sudo chown lisa:lisa /home/lisa`

- Issue: Can't `su - lisa`  
  â†’ Make sure the shell is set in `/etc/passwd` and that a password is set.

## Concepts:

- `/etc/passwd` â€“ Stores basic user info  
- `/etc/shadow` â€“ Stores encrypted passwords  
- `/etc/group` â€“ Stores group memberships  
- `/etc/gshadow` â€“ Stores group passwords

## Next Step:
- Write a Bash script that creates users and sets default directories and permissions.
