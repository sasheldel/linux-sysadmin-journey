# 📁 Chapter 3: Navigating the Linux File System (My Notes)

## 🌲 Understanding the File System Layout

- The root directory `/` is like the base of everything — all files and folders live under it.
- Key folders:
  - `/bin`: Basic commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`.
  - `/etc`: System-wide settings and config files.
  - `/home`: Where each user’s personal folder lives, like `/home/ryan`.
  - `/var`: Log files and dynamic content.
  - `/tmp`: Temporary files, often cleared at reboot.
  - `/usr`: Where user apps and utilities go.
  - `/dev`: Represents devices like USB drives.
  - `/mnt` and `/media`: Where external drives get mounted.
  - `/opt`: Extra apps not part of the main OS.

## 📍 Paths — Absolute vs. Relative

- **Absolute path** starts from `/` (root). Example: `/home/sasakovich/Documents`.
- **Relative path** is from wherever you are now.
