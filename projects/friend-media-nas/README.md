# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Friend Media NAS Project

This project is part of the *Linux Sysadmin Journey* — a collaborative, self-hosted NAS setup for sharing media and learning system administration through real-world application.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a private, Linux-powered NAS (Network Attached Storage) and media ecosystem where you and a friend can:

- Backup and access DVD rips, eBooks, and other media
